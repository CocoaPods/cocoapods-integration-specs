Integrating target `Pods-SampleApp` (`SampleApp.xcodeproj` project)
  Adding Build Phase '[CP] Check Pods Manifest.lock' to project.
  - Running post install hooks
    - cocoapods-stats from `cocoapods-stats/lib/cocoapods_plugin.rb`

-> Pod installation complete! There are 0 dependencies from the Podfile and 0 total pods installed.

[!] The Podfile does not contain any dependencies.

[!] Automatically assigning platform `osx` with version `10.8` on target `SampleApp` because no platform was specified. Please specify a platform for this target in your Podfile. See `https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#platform`.
