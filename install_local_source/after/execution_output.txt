Integrating client project

[!] Please close any current Xcode sessions and use `SampleApp.xcworkspace` for this project from now on.

Integrating target `Pods-iOS App` (`SampleApp.xcodeproj` project)
  Adding Build Phase '[CP] Check Pods Manifest.lock' to project.
  - Running post install hooks
    - cocoapods-stats from `cocoapods-stats/lib/cocoapods_plugin.rb`

-> Pod installation complete! There is 1 dependency from the Podfile and 1 total pod installed.

[!] The `iOS App [Release]` target overrides the `OTHER_CFLAGS` build setting defined in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-iOS App/Pods-iOS App.release.xcconfig'. This can lead to problems with the CocoaPods installation
    - Use the `$(inherited)` flag, or
    - Remove the build settings from the target.
