Realm Documentation
===================

## Docs

You probably want to go and [read the docs on the Realm project website](http://realm.io/docs/ios/latest/).

## API Reference

You probably want to go and [read the API reference on the Realm project website](http://realm.io/docs/ios/latest/api). The API reference is generated from comments in the source code of this repository.

You can generate the API docs locally by running `sh build.sh docs` from the root of this repository. This requires installation of [appledoc](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc/releases/tag/v2.2-963). You will find the output `docs/output/`.

You can view the docset locally with tools like [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) or in Xcode directly with e.g. [Docs for XCode](http://georiot.co/docsforxcode) using the packages generated in `docs/output/` or via the links in the upper right corner of our [online docs](http://realm.io/docs/ios/latest/).
