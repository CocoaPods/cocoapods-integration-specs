 * if the attribute value already exists; or if the attribute value
 * exists and has a particular value before changing it. <p>Each item in
 * <i>Expected</i> represents an attribute name for Amazon DynamoDB to
 * check, along with the following: <ul> <li> <p><i>Value</i> - The
 * attribute value for Amazon DynamoDB to check. </li> <li>
 * <p><i>Exists</i> - Causes Amazon DynamoDB to evaluate the value before
 * attempting a conditional operation: <ul> <li> <p>If <i>Exists</i> is
 * <code>true</code>, Amazon DynamoDB will check to see if that attribute
 * value already exists in the table. If it is found, then the operation
 * succeeds. If it is not found, the operation fails with a
 * <i>ConditionalCheckFailedException</i>. </li> <li> <p>If <i>Exists</i>
 * is <code>false</code>, Amazon DynamoDB assumes that the attribute
 * value does <i>not</i> exist in the table. If in fact the value does
 * not exist, then the assumption is valid and the operation succeeds. If
 * the value is found, despite the assumption that it does not exist, the
 * operation fails with a <i>ConditionalCheckFailedException</i>. </li>
 * </ul> <p>The default setting for <i>Exists</i> is <code>true</code>.
 * If you supply a <i>Value</i> all by itself, Amazon DynamoDB assumes
 * the attribute exists: You don't have to set <i>Exists</i> to
 * <code>true</code>, because it is implied. <p>Amazon DynamoDB returns a
 * <i>ValidationException</i> if: <ul> <li> <p><i>Exists</i> is
 * <code>true</code> but there is no <i>Value</i> to check. (You expect a
 * value to exist, but don't specify what that value is.) </li> <li>
 * <p><i>Exists</i> is <code>false</code> but you also specify a
 * <i>Value</i>. (You cannot expect an attribute to have a value, while
 * also expecting it not to exist.) </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>If you
 * specify more than one condition for <i>Exists</i>, then all of the
 * conditions must evaluate to true. (In other words, the conditions are
 * ANDed together.) Otherwise, the conditional operation will fail.
